## Location and Participants 

Family members can be tested anywhere. If the user is a student, they can be tested on campus.

## Script
Make them download the app and create a new account. The next step is to give testers the scenarios and for each scenario we take notes on their actions and feedbacks.

## Data
* Participant #1
    * Dog owner
    * Used own device
    * Scenario 1 Feedback: Was able to keep track of new pet's weight. Thinks this is valuable to help maintain a healthy weight for pet.
    * Scenario 2 Feedback: The forum page seemed handy to hear other peoples opinions if it was real.
    * Scenario 3 Feedback: Make feeding schedule send push notification when to feed pet. Maybe add in medication times as well.
    * Scenario 4 Feedback: Make food item page be a database to find different foods, so you can search for other foods that have a different nutrient profile.
    * The vet page doesn't work, but it sounds like a fun idea.
    * UI looks alright
    * Make login remember last login
* Participant #2
    * Dog owner.
    * iOS user so they used one of our devices.
    * Scenario 1 Feedback: When adding a new pet to list, remove time of pet's birth. Would be nice to also add your own pet's image for its profile picture.
    * Scenario 2 Feedback: Tried to look up a question but could not find any post. More posts should be added.
    * Scenario 3 Feedback: Notification for schedule page seems fun to have. Maybe add more custom notifications for your pet, such as "Starving".
    * Scenario 4 Feedback: Food catalog page would be very useful because it's hard to remember the nutrients that your pet needs.
* Participant #3
    * Cat owner.
    * iOS user so they used one of our devices.
    * Scenario 1 Feedback: Liked how you can input different weights and save them. Wanted more features for cats.
    * Scenario 2 Feedback: Forum would be nice if users could interact with each other. Vet page could use AI for common sense questions or frequently asked questions.
    * Scenario 3 Feedback: Schedule page could have push notifications outside the app.
    * Scenario 4 Feedback: Food catalog page needs to first ask permission to use photos.  
* Participant #4
    * New dog owner.
    * Used one of our devices.
    * Scenario 1 Feedback: Breed option should be optional for people who don't know their pet's breed.
    * Scenario 2 Feedback: Forum page could include links to recommended food brands.
    * Scenario 3 Feedback: N/A
    * Scenario 4 Feedback: Surprised by how calorie info from the food label photo was read. It's a great way for busy people to add food labels without having to type in all the nutritional details.
* Participant #5
    * Owns two dogs.
    * Used android device.
    * Scenario 1 Feedback: Liked the profile icons and that you can modify the dog's information.
    * Scenario 2 Feedback: Add more words to search in the forum. Instead of having questions only, it would be nice if there were also stories on owning overweight pets and how owners overcame obstacles.
    * Scenario 3 Feedback: Color blocks for the schedule page look great. The app could use those colors as a theme.
    * Scenario 4 Feedback: It would be nice if the food catalog recommended feeding portions.
